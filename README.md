<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Heart Risk Prediction with Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting heart disease risk using a CatBoost machine learning model. The solution includes data preprocessing, model development, and the creation of an interactive user interface with Streamlit. We also implement a FastAPI-based API for real-time predictions and package the entire solution using Docker for scalable deployment. This end-to-end project offers a comprehensive approach to heart risk prediction, integrating modern tools for seamless operation and deployment.
